# SUSTAINABLE POWER GENERATION IN INDIA : LEVARAGING LSTMs AND XAI FOR ENHANCED EFFICIENCY
This project focuses on forecasting daily power generation in India using Multivariate LSTM models, integrating Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME) for transparency and interpretability. The research aims to enhance efficiency, reliability, and decision-making in the power sector.

ðŸš€ Project Overview - 
Dataset: Power generation data (2017-2022) from 182 stations.
Tech Stack: Python, TensorFlow, LSTM, Explainable AI (XAI), SHAP, LIME,Causal Impact Analysis
Objective: Forecast power generation and analyze influential factors to optimze resouces in power sector.

I.Key Features : 
âœ” LSTM-based forecasting for short-term power generation trends.
âœ” Causal Impact Analysis to assess external factors (e.g., maintenance).
âœ” Explainable AI (SHAP, LIME) to interpret model decisions.
âœ” Data Imputation (handling missing/zero values).

II.Results & Insights : 
âœ… Accurate 30-day forecasting for Maharashtra and Punjab power stations.
âœ… SHAP analysis identified key drivers of power fluctuations.
âœ… Causal Impact Analysis revealed the effect of maintenance events.
